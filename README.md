# 🧠 Data Analysis Project – Layoffs Dataset

## 📌 Overview
This project involves a full data analysis pipeline using SQL and other tools.  
The dataset represents layoffs in companies across different industries and countries.  
The process includes **data cleaning**, **exploratory analysis**, and **visualizations**.

## 📋 Project Stages Checklist

- ✅ Data Cleaning (SQL – MySQL Workbench)
- ✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- ⏳ Data Visualization (in progress)

## 🧰 Tools Used

- SQL (MySQL)
- MySQL Workbench
- Planned: Power BI / Tableau

---

## 🧼 Data Cleaning Steps (SQL)

1. Removed duplicate rows
2. Standardized column values (e.g., formatting, capitalization)
3. Handled null and blank values
4. Dropped irrelevant or empty columns/rows

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (SQL)

- Questions explored so far:
- Maximum layoffs and full-percentage layoffs
- Layoffs by company, industry, country, year, and month
- Rolling totals of layoffs over time
- Top companies and industries by year using window functions

> See: `eda_script.sql` for full query list  
> Summary findings will be added in `eda_summary.md`
